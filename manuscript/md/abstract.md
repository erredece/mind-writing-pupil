++Here we present a new human-computer interface that is based on decoding of attention through pupillometry. Our method builds on the recent finding that the pupillary light response is modulated by covert visual attention: When you covertly (without looking at) attend to a bright stimulus, your pupil constricts relative to when you attend to a dark stimulus. Participants mentally select (i.e. covertly attend to to) one of several letters presented in a circular arrangement. Each letter is presented on a separate background with oscillating brightness. Small changes in pupil size reflect the brightness oscillations of (the background of) the selected letter, and this allows us to determine which letter the participant intends to select. The performance of our method is comparable to the best covert-attention-based brain-computer interfaces to date, and has several key advantages: no movement other than pupil-size change is required; no physical contact is required (i.e. no electrodes); it is intuitive, because there is a direct mapping between the task (attending to a letter) and the goal (selecting a letter); it can be done with currently available, off-the-shelf eye trackers; and it is very reliable. Potential applications include: communication with totally locked-in patients, training of sustained attention, and ultra-secure password input.++
