Prior to the training program discussed in the main text, we conducted five pilot experiments to optimize the system's design. In all pilot experiments, two authors (SM and LvdL) served as participants. (The authors only participated in the pilot experiments; for the training program described in the main text, all participants were naive.) In each experiment, we varied one parameter, and then continued with the parameter value that resulted in fastest responses. We tested only one-of-two selections. These pilot experiments were purely exploratory; no statistical testing was performed, and no interpretations are provided. We report these pilot experiments for completeness, but their main goal was to aid in the design of the system.

## Accuracy

Across all pilot experiments, only 5 of 2,064 selections were incorrect (99.8% accuracy). Therefore, accuracy was not analyzed further.

## Starting parameters

Aside from the parameters discussed below, the procedure and stimuli were identical to those described in the Methods of the main text. We started with a stimulus eccentricity of 7.3°, a stimulus size of 1.5° (i.e. the radius of the stimulus' backgrounds), and a display-background luminance of 22.9 cd/m².

## Pilot Experiment 1: Stimulus configuration

We tested the following geometric configurations (80 selections per configuration):

- Horizontal: Two letters on the horizontal axis, left and right of fixation (%FigPilotParadigmExp1::a).
- Up+: Two letters in the upper visual field with mirror-symmetric placeholders in the lower visual field (%FigPilotParadigmExp1::b).
- Down+: Two letters in the lower visual field with mirror-symmetric placeholders in the upper visual field (%FigPilotParadigmExp1::c).
- Up-: Two letters in the upper visual field (%FigPilotParadigmExp1::d).
- Down-: Two letters in the lower visual field (%FigPilotParadigmExp1::e).

Configuration was varied within blocks. Based on response time (%FigPilotResults::a), we continued with the Up+ configuration.

## Pilot Experiment 2: Stimulus eccentricity

We tested the following stimulus eccentricities (128 selections per eccentricity): 3.86°, 7.15°, 10.47°, and 13.76°. Eccentricity was varied within blocks. Based on response time (%FigPilotResults::b), we continued with an eccentricity of 13.76°.

## Pilot Experiment 3: Stimulus size

We tested the following stimulus sizes (128 selections per size): 0.78°, 1.55°, 2.33°, and 3.11°. The size referred to the radius of the stimulus' backgrounds. Size was varied within blocks. Based on response time (%FigPilotResults::c), we continued with a stimulus size of 3.11°.

## Pilot Experiment 4: More stimulus eccentricities

We felt that the optimal eccentricity might differ for the new stimulus size selected during Pilot Experiment 3 (3.11°). In addition, we noticed that a full circle of stimuli did not fit on the screen with the previously selected eccentricity (13.76°). Therefore, we tested two new eccentricities (128 selections per eccentricity): 8.82° and 10.49°. Eccentricity was varied within blocks.

There was little overall effect of eccentricity on selection speed (%FigPilotResults::d), and the optimal eccentricity was different for the two participants (not shown). Therefore, we continued with an intermediate eccentricity of 9.2°.

## Pilot Experiment 5: Display-background luminance

We tested the following display-background luminances (128 selections per size): 3.6 cd/m² (dark), 22.9 cd/m² (medium), and 61.5 cd/m² (bright). Background luminance was varied between blocks of 16 selections. Block order was randomized.

Clearly, dark display backgrounds are more effective than bright display backgrounds (%FigPilotResults::e). However, the darkest display background that we tested (3.6 cd/m²) seemed to merge with the dark phase of the stimulus' backgrounds; that is, the stimulus' backgrounds seemed to disappear when they were dark. Therefore, we continued with a slightly less dark display background (13.0 cd/m²).
