We have introduced a new human-computer interface (HCI) that is based on decoding of covert attention through pupillometry. Participant select a letter by covertly attending to it, without making any overt (eye) movement. Letters are presented within circles of oscillating brightness. Small changes in pupil size reflect the oscillating brightness of the attended stimulus [reviewed in @MathVan+der+stigchel2015CurrDir], which allows us to determine which stimulus the participant intends to select.

In the experiment reported here, with healthy untrained participants, our method reached a selection accuracy of around 90%, and an information-transfer rate (ITR) of 4.36 bits/min (%FigITR). During pilot studies with highly trained participants (authors SM and LL), we have systematically reached near-perfect accuracy and ITRs of more than 8 bits/min. (Pilot data is available online; see Methods - Materials and availability.) For comparison, P300 spellers that are based on covert attention (i.e. without eye movements) reach an ITR of around 6 bits/min [based on visual spellers reviewed in @Riccio2012JNeuralEng], usually with a combination of trained and untrained participants [e.g., @Treder2011JNeuralEng;@AcqualagnaBlankertz2013]. The performance of our method is thus in the same range as that of the best non-invasive covert-attention BCIs to date.

An important advantage of our method, especially when compared to EEG-based methods, is its ease of use. Only a pupillometer, or an eye tracker that records pupil size, is required. For our experiments, we have used a research-grade eye tracker. But we have also used our method successfully with a low-cost eye tracker that provides high-quality pupil-size measurements [@Dalmaijer2014Eyetribe]. Our method does not require calibration of the eye tracker, nor training of the selection algorithm. Together, these characteristics set our method apart from currently available BCIs.

The prototypical application of a HCI/ BCI is as a means of communication for completely locked-in patients, that is, patients with complete loss of motor control [@Birbaumer2006Breaking]. P300 spellers and pupillometry-based methods have been used successfully in partly locked-in patients with some remaining motor control [e.g., @Marchetti2013Covert;@Stoll2013CurrBiol]. But success with completely locked-in patients has so far been modest. Important reasons for this limited success are [cf. @Birbaumer2006Breaking]: difficulty of use; low accuracy; skin problems due to EEG electrodes; low communication speeds; and the need for sustained attention. Our method solves some of these problems by providing ease of use, avoiding physical contact, and providing high accuracy. But other challenges remain, notably low communication speed and the need for sustained attention. In addition, it is unclear to what extent the pupillary light response, which our method relies on, remains intact in completely locked-in state [@Bauer1979JNeurol]. Therefore, future studies are needed to determine how well our method, or a variation thereof, works in patient groups.

A second application is as an ultra-secure way to enter passwords or PIN codes. Imagine a cash machine that is equipped with a pupillometer. To enter a PIN code, the user would be presented with a display similar to that shown in %FigParadigm::a, and enter digits by covertly attending to them. Based on our results (see %FigFullBarPlot), entering a four-digit PIN code would take around two minutes. This is slow, but feasible, and could be useful in situations that require high security.

A third application is as a way to train sustained attention. To select a letter, participants must attend to it for some time, which is effortful. Therefore, our method might be useful for training sustained attention in a fun way that may be attractive also for children, especially when it is superficially redesigned to be more game-like.

In conclusion, we have presented a new, pupillometry-based method to translate thought into letters. Our method is highly accurate, is easy to use, and does not require expensive equipment or extensive preparation and training. We have highlighted communication with completely locked-in patients, ultra-secure password input, and training of sustained attention as possible applications.
